# Bug Run!

## Description

Welcome to the Bug Run JavaScript Game!  This was project 3 of Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program.  I was provided with the game engine and assets (see: initial commit).  From there I had to research and build a complete game using ES6 OOP Classes.

## Installation

Download or close the project from this repository- then open the 'index.html' in your browser of choice and start playing!

## How to Play

All movement is done with the arrow keys.  Your character starts at the bottom of the screen and you have 3 chances to get your character to the top of the pasture without colliding with a bug to win the game!<br />

If you do collide with a bug your character will be sent back to the starting position on the board, looking a little worse for wear.

## Project Features
• Game tracks number of collisions, changing the character model slightly each time.<br />
• Game resets either after the 3rd collision, or when the game is won.<br />
• Every enemy has a speed that randomizes on every pass so no two games are the same.
